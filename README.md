Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I can't find who works at the BoE or how to email the BoE.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for absentee voting in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.
    - Two of the provided election dates are incorrect.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page is pretty, but information-free.
    - The Voting Information page has a lot to cover, and could be made into a couple of briefer pages.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The link color is a bit jarring against the background.
    - The footer would look more like a footer if it had a different background.
